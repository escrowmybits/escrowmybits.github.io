Welcome to Escrow my Bits, (“EMB”) the online escrow service provider for regular and multi-signature cryptocurrency transactions.
Escrow my Bits uses cryptocurrency transactions and multi-signature services to allow users to enter into an agreement (such as online commerce) with any other user, and to make sure that if the transaction fails, a selected third party ('judge') will be able to withhold payment. This intermediary trust service will add certainty to your online financial transactions. 
EMB Gives users the confidence to proceed with Online Purchases and virtual currency transactions by maintaining escrow of funds on your behalf.
EMB provides the capabilities to support Online Escrow Services, while we do not guarantee the quality of any online purchases or judgements, we do ensure quick, secure, and accurate completion of financial transactions once any disputes are resolved. Escrow my Bits does not guarantee the quality or fairness of the judges on our site, however the site will provide users with tools to publicly rate and review judges.
Escrow my Bits shall not be liable for any damage or loss of property.
“YOU” (You is defined as a User of the Escrow My Bits Web Site and Services.) agree, you will not use Escrow my Bits for any illegal or fraudulent transactions or agreements.  Fraudulent or any illegal transactions, whether made intentionally or not, with the knowledge of illegality or not, shall be null and void. EMB will not hold any funds or property for any entity nor knowingly have any associations or dealings with illegal or fraudulent activity, people, or companies representing such illegal activities.
The Following are EMB's Terms of Service:
1. Registration & Eligibility: By signing up to the Escrow my Bits service, you hereby acknowledge and accept these terms and agree to be bound by them. In order to use the Escrow my Bits service you will be required to maintain your account details securely and adhere to Escrow my Bits' terms of eligibility.
Please note that even if you do not register and do not provide any identifying means to Escrow my Bits, you must comply with these eligibility terms.
1. Creating a User Account: In order to use the Services, you will be required to set up a user account, this account may be used to either participate in transactions or adjudicate         transactions.
2. Eligibility: You hereby affirm that you comply with the EMB eligibility Terms.  If you are operating on a behalf of a corporation, you affirm that all employees of the corporation who are users of the Service adhere to these terms as well.
2.A) Adult: You are over 18 years of age, or if you are a corporation, the corporation is legitimate, solvent, registered, and legally capable of entering into this Agreement.
2.B) Residence:  You do not reside in any State or Municipality where the use of Escrow Services or Virtual Currency Transactions are prohibited.
2.C) Solvent: You are solvent and are not currently bankrupt, or involved in a liquidation or debt arrangement and otherwise have not lost your ability to commit to these terms.
2.D) Authorized: If you are acting on behalf of a corporation, then you certify that you are authorized to enter into these terms on behalf of said corporation.
3. Authentication: If you choose to register to the Services, Escrow my Bits shall authenticate your identity using services at their disposal, and may request additional authentication. Please note that for most services, identity verification may not be required.
4. Security and integrity of account: Due to the sensitivity of information stored on your behalf and the potential risk of loss of revenues or virtual property, you may be required to store and be able to retrieve and supply back to EMB a secret key provided to you from Escrow my Bits. Please keep in mind that Escrow my Bits strongly encourages the use of strong account protection and that using the same account for more than one user or in more than one website is considered a bad practice.
Please note that if you receive a private key or secret key from Escrow my Bits, you must keep it safe and available, as there will be no other way to access your account.  
You Acknowledge that sharing your EMB secret or private key will give others access to your funds and will make your transaction insecure.
4.A) Sharing your login data: You are specifically prohibited from sharing your  secret key and/or private keys with any 3rd party. Your public key can be shared freely with any 3rd parties.
4.B) Notification:  a. You are required to inform Escrow my Bits, immediately, in any case where you believe that your account was breached and in any case in which you are aware of any unauthorized use of any Escrow my Bits account. 
b. You are required to Inform EMB immediately if your private or secret keys have been compromised or stolen.
4.C) Escrow my Bits' Liability: Escrow my Bits shall not be liable in any case where you did not adhere to our published security guidelines and will not be able to assist you if you ignore and not comply with Escrow my Bits' documented best practices. 

2. Sending or Receiving cryptocurrencies: Escrow my Bits may allow you to utilize the Multi-Signature feature in some cryptocurrencies in order to send or receive cryptocurrency; however, these transactions are between you and the transacting party, and Escrow my Bits is not a party to such transaction. In such case, you and the other party to the transaction may choose to select a judge from the list of Judges on the Escrow my Bits website and appoint him/her as the Judge in case of a dispute. In turn, all the parties to the transaction shall enter their public (or private) keys and/or secret keys as required to complete agreed to transactions.
Once the terms of the transaction are finalized, and the transaction is executed, the cryptocurrency shall be released by the consent of 2 out of 3 from the selling party, the receiving party and the Judge or in the case of a transaction that does not utilize the Multi-Signature feature the cryptocurrency shall be released by Escrow my Bits or the selected Judge. 
If any dispute arises, then the Judge's ruling shall be final unless an appeal is filed prior to the end of a 3(three) day period starting from the time the Judge makes a ruling. Should an appeal be filed, the filing party will be required to make a small deposit that is equal to a small percentage of the transaction. The percentage will be decided on a case by case basis and once set cannot be changed. Appeal rulings are final.  Depending on the ruling, either a refund to the filing party will be made for the deposit, or the deposit from the filing party will be kept.
3. Listing as a Judge: You may list yourself as a Judge for any transaction,. However, please note that in the following cases, you cannot act as a Judge: (i) in any case of conflict of interest and/or have any personal or professional relation with any of the transacting parties; (ii) if you cannot provide unbiased Judgement due to any of your personal beliefs; (iii) if you are personally interested in the result of the conflict or appeal and/or could benefit personally from the outcome of the transaction.
As a Judge in an EMB transaction, You are solely responsible for laying out the terms of any Judgement you manage and making sure both parties have agreed to them in writing and there is no disagreement.  
4. Solely Legal Transactions: You may only use Escrow my Bits' services for legal and ethical transactions. While Escrow my Bits may monitor your transactions, you are fully responsible for and specifically prohibited from entering into any transaction which (i) involves the sale of illegal goods and/or services such as illegal/prohibited firearms or munitions, child pornography, illicit drugs, violent material or trafficking in women; (ii) involves the infringement of 3rd party rights, such as copyright and the right for privacy; (iii) involves illegal gambling or any other sort of financial fraudulent activity such as trading in binary options, pyramid schemes, multilevel marketing or similar activity; (iv) misleads consumers; (v) sells any pharmaceutical drugs without prescription or sells any homeopathic, "magic", or other non-clinically proven medicine; (vi) involves trade with users or entities that are illegal according to, or specifically forbidden by New Jersey State, or USA Federal Laws and policies; (vii) is related to the funding of any terrorist or criminal organizations (as per USA, UN, and EU official lists) or their members or representatives.
